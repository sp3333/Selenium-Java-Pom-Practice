Test base is parent class of all class
Test base will support scripts
Test base is main class of our project


UIAction is Page factory
We have to always create one constructor of a class that 
is pageFactory in PageFactory class only

PageFactory.initelements(driver, this)
this refers to the current class object


In selenium if there is error like unable to locate element 
the u should go to html and see that that web element or link
if it is inside the iframe
Use ..driver.switchTo().frame(driver.findElement(By.id("")))
